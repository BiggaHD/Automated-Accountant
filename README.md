It contains many other features, like giving loans to employees, tracking their installments, making annual/ monthly reports, and so much more. It looks and feels great thanks to great structure and design, and even though it possesses a lot of features, the complexity is hidden from the end user, so it always appears easy to use, no matter what level of functionality you choose to use. It uses **ReactJS** on the frontend and **NodeJS** on the backend.
