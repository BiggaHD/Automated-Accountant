> #### This is a **EMS software** - [Employee management system] that can help companies reduce their time spent on salaries, penalties, bonuses and a lot of other things regarding the accounting department, as well as many things regarding HR department [adding a new employee is only a few clicks away, and giving an end date is only a click away]. It contains many other features, like giving loans to employees, tracking their installments, making annual/ monthly reports, and so much more. It looks and feels great thanks to great structure and design, and even though it possesses a lot of features, the complexity is hidden from the end user, so it always appears easy to use, no matter what level of functionality you choose to use. It uses **ReactJS** on the frontend and **NodeJS** on the backend.

> #### In order to use this app, you'll have to set up your own Google Sheets API, get the necessary credentials, and replace them in this project. That needs to be done in the config.js files [backend & frontend]. Also, I recommend checking out the 'Local Setup' docs which you can find in this repo to get you started. Additionally, this is a work in process, and as I go along I'll update instructions. Currently working on adding new features.
